# BMI Calculator

Welcome to the BMI Calculator Repository. This web application, built on the Express.js framework and utilizing Node.js, was developed concurrently with my journey of learning Node.js, serving both as a practical application of acquired skills and a project to enhance my understanding of Node.js.

### What is the BMI Calculator?

The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator helps determine the BMI value and corresponding weight status, taking age into account. You can use the "Metric Units" tab for the International System of Units or the "Other Units" tab to convert units into US or metric units. Additionally, this calculator computes the Ponderal Index, explained in detail below.

- **Healthy BMI Range:** 18.5 kg/m² - 25 kg/m²
- **Healthy Weight for Height:** 59.9 kgs - 81.0 kgs
- **Ponderal Index:** 11.1 kg/m³

The web app is basic and does not include a `style.css` file as it was developed during the early stages of learning backend development.

#### Running the App

To run this application, open your terminal and enter the following command in your termianl:
